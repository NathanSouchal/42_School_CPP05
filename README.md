# C++ Module 05 — Exceptions

This repository contains **Module 05** of the 42 C++ Piscine.  
It focuses on **exception handling** in C++ — learning how to **throw, catch, and define your own exceptions** to manage runtime errors properly and safely.

---

## Objectives

- Understand how to use **`try` / `catch` / `throw`**
- Learn to write **safe and robust code** with proper error handling
- Define and use **custom exception classes**
- Handle exceptions using **inheritance and polymorphism**
- Discover `std::exception` and its best practices

---

## Key Concepts

- `try`, `catch`, and `throw` blocks
- Stack unwinding
- `std::exception` and overriding `what()`
- Custom exception classes
- Exception safety (especially in constructors/destructors)
- Catching by reference (`catch (const std::exception &e)`)
